'''
This module supports the following schema:

ID — The ID is the primary key of the table, or the main identifier of each record. It should automatically increment each time a new record is added, using the AUTOINCREMENT keyword. This column is an INTEGER type; the rest are TEXT.
Title — The title is required because it’s hard to skim your existing bookmarks if they’re only URLs. You can tell SQLite the column can’t be empty by using the NOT NULL keyword.
URL — The URL is required, so it gets NOT NULL as well.
Notes — Notes for a bookmark are optional, so only the TEXT specifier is necessary.
Date — The date the bookmark was added is required, so it gets NOT NULL.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookmarks
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    date_added TEXT NOT NULL
);

        The _execute method should:

        1. Accept a statement as a string argument
        2. Get a cursor from the database connection
        3. Execute a statement using the cursor (more on this shortly)
        4. Return the cursor, which has stored the result of the executed statement (if any)        

        this is designed to use placeholders in SQL statements to insert values

        2. Constructs a placeholder string (a ? for each column specified)
        3. Constructs the string of the column names
        4. Gets the column values as a tuple (A dictionary’s .values() returns a dict_ values object, which happens not to work with sqlite3’s execute method.)
